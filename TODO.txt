1. Refine the job_title extraction logic to handle edge cases.
       a. Add more test cases for unusual job titles.
       b. Research if it's best to use regex or a dedicated library for parsing job titles.
       c. Research if it's use AI to extract job titles more accurately.

2. Improve the performance of the data processing pipeline.
       a. Profile the current implementation to identify bottlenecks.
       b. Explore parallel processing or batching techniques.
       c. Optimize database queries if applicable.

3. Enhance error handling and logging mechanisms.
       a. Learn about Logging and apply the knowledge here
       b. Implement structured logging for better traceability.

4. Improve AI prompts for better accuracy.
       a. Experiment with different prompt structures.
       b. Analyze the responses to identify patterns of inaccuracies.
       c. Research best practices for prompt engineering.
       d. Prompts should ask AI for projects that helps users to demonstrate not only their coding skills but also
           their software engineering skills such as system design, testing, and documentation. Priority should be
           given to skills that are currently in high demand in the job market.

5. Implement runners that will update database with current jobs every day.
         a. Research scheduling libraries or tools that can automate this process.
         b. Ensure that the runner handles failures gracefully and can resume from the last successful state.
         c. Runners should scrape the internet or access APIs to get the most recent job postings.
         d. Runners should have a list of common and popular job titles to look for when updating the database.
         e. Create a database of jobs that users search so that when a user searches for a job, and it is not found in
             the database, the runner will pick it up and search on the job boards. (A self-improving DB)

6. Create a user interface for this project.

7. Merge Indeed's database with this database

8. Database Optimization
         a. Analyze the current database schema for potential improvements.
         b. Implement indexing strategies to speed up query performance.
         c. Consider data partitioning or sharding if the dataset is large.
         d. PRIORITY: Optimize the database query to ensure  that edge cases like "Software Engineer II" or "Senior Developer" and
            " Software Engineer" and "Software Engineering" are accurately matched and retrieved.

9. Optimize the whole app so that users can input a job description and title and get the most relevant projects that match their skills and interests.
         a. Implement a recommendation algorithm that considers user preferences and past interactions.
         b. Use machine learning techniques to improve the relevance of project suggestions over time.
         c. Ensure that the app is responsive and provides a seamless user experience across different devices.

10. JOBS
         a. PRIORITY: Ensure that link to job postings is returned together with the response.
         b. When data is stalled, new jobs should be appended to the database and old jobs should be removed only when it
           is passed the threshold of 7 days.

11. Prompts and AI
        a. FUTURE: Refine the AI prompts to ensure that the projects suggested are not only relevant to the user's skills but also
           align with their career goals and interests. This may involve asking users for more specific information about their
           preferences and aspirations.
        b. PRIORITY: Currently, the AI prompts asks the LLM to suggest projects relevant to current job market trends and demands
           in terms of skills and technologies needed. However, the LLM does not have access to real-time data on job market trends.
           To address this, we can implement a mechanism to regularly update the AI's knowledge base with the latest job market information.
           This could involve:
                a. Scraping job boards, analyzing job postings, and feeding this data into the AI model to ensure that the project suggestions are
                based on the most current trends and demands in the job market. (This needs a deeper thought)
                b. Enhance the LLM with tools that can access real-time data, such as web scraping tools or APIs that provide up-to-date information on job market trends.
                This way, the LLM can generate project suggestions that are more relevant to the current job market demands.
                (This also needs a deeper thought)
        c. Use LLM to determine whether a user prompt/request is asking for recommendations or other stuff. Then route the request to the appropriate handler.
           For example, if a user is asking for project recommendations, route the request to the recommendation engine. If a user is asking for information about a specific job title,
           route the request to a different handler that can provide detailed information about that job title.
           This will help ensure that users receive accurate and relevant responses based on their specific needs and queries. (This also needs a deeper thought)
